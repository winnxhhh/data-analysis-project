# DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT

Welcome to my first data analysis project, where I analysed data of Korean Pop (K-Pop) idols active in the past 20 years. I made it for a midterm project in January 2024, which was also my first time using Python. I used Jupyter Notebooks to make the data analyses and report.

Enjoy!
